This code is written to run with python version 3.0 or greater.
This is run with Python 3.6.8 and the executable is available in '/usr/bin/python3'.
The application is run from 'pythoncode/api_app' directory as:
    /usr/bin/python3 filesapi.py /mnt/c/PracticeProjects/files-tests/src/errorinstallingubuntu.txt
        where '/usr/bin/python3' is the python interpreter,
              'filesapi.py' is the application that is run
          and '/mnt/c/PracticeProjects/files-tests/src/errorinstallingubuntu.txt' is the file to be uploaded with the full path name.
The application uses the class defined in the file "files/files_api.py". The class has initialization function that initializes:
    - the endpoint to connect to, and
    - the api key to use for the RestAPI calls.
These are initialized via the data file "files/data/test_data.py". This data file relies on two environment variables: i.e., ENDPOINT, and API_KEY.These two environment variables need to be set and exported as a first step in an OS depended script.

This setup uses a file 'envvars' in "pythoncode" directory.
