This directory contains code for testing both the API and UI.

Create a local repository in your work space by creating a clone as 'git clone https://github.com/mpdass/filestest.git'.
This will download all the files from this git repository into your workspace under the directory 'filestests'.
Explore this directory by navigating to each directory to get familiarize yourself.

The API test code is written in python using 'requests' package and is in the directory 'src/pythoncode'.
The UI test codes is written in Java using 'selenium' framework and is in the directory 'src/javacode'.

The 'build.xml' file in the 'src' directory is based off of 'ant' tasks. Either you can run the java application using the 'uitestcases.jar'
in 'src/lib' directory or creating a jar file by compiling the source code as 'ant package' from the source directory. This assumes that 
your environment has necessary JDK and ant package installed.  Once, this is done without any errors, it creates a 'src/lib/uitestcases.jar'
file.

Take a look at the 'envvars' file and if needed make necessary adjustments to your environment.

The java application can be run by running 'run_ui_test.sh and the python application can be run using 'run_api_test.sh' script.

Development is underway to implement a complete pipeline from cloning to running the test using 'Jenkins' and will be uploaded once that
is completed.
